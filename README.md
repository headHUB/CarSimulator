## Story
We realized a project for the school to several.
The goal was to take a classic radio controlled car, and control it with a steering wheel and pedals. In addition, we paired the car with an FPV camera (normally designed for drones) and an FPV headset to view the video stream of the car.

### Informations and details
Materials used : 
- 1 motor for direction controll
- 2 motor for camera (axe X , Y )
- 1 module High Frequency 433 MHz 
- 1 gyroscope / acceleromerter 
- 1 motor 1/5 e
- 2 batteries 12 V 
* Arduino Leonardo
Head (controlleur):
- 1 module High Frequency
- 1 gyroscope / accelerometer
+  Arduino Uno

### Installing
For basic arduino coding , you need Arduino IDE for push the code inside , but if you have an other IDE you can use it :) .
* [Download Arduino IDE ](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) 
Download and install lib 
* [Grove_LoRa_Radio ](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove_LoRa_Radio/#download-library) for Grove - LoRa Radio 433 MHz 
* [RF24 ](https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/rf24) wifi comunications
